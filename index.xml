The major differences are:
You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc. There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://scopecomms.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 21:48:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://scopecomms.github.io/about/</guid><description>This is a &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; example website for the blogdown package.

Our Approach Scientists create beer labels with accessible language about their research findings. The public events include scientific presentations geared for the local community, benefiting both scientists and non-scientists.
Beer Series We collaborate with Steel String Brewery to create science-themed beverages that communicate complex research in accessible ways.
Loopapalooza Pale Ale This pale ale features educational content about DNA folding and its role in genetic diseases.</description></item><item><title>Social Media</title><link>https://scopecomms.github.io/social-media/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scopecomms.github.io/social-media/</guid><description>Follow SCOPE on Social Media Stay connected with our latest events, panels, and science communication resources.
