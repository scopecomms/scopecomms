## About SCOPE

SCOPE (Science Communication and Outreach for Public Engagement) is an initiative aimed at equipping scientists from all career stages, backgrounds, and disciplines with tools to build, maintain, and strengthen their communities' trust in science.

Our mission is to create a collaborative environment for the next generation of scientists to share innovative approaches and community engagement strategies, empowering scientists across the globe to communicate science effectively with communities at large.

## Our Initiatives

SCOPE currently focuses on two main initiatives:

### Virtual Panels

Our virtual workshops feature graduate students who have led successful projects and initiatives in helping the public build trust in science. These online sessions allow participants to learn from peers who have developed effective science communication strategies.

### Brewing Scientists

We combine science communication with craft brewing to create engaging public events in collaboration with Steel String Brewery. Scientists create beer labels with accessible language about their research, and we host events where the public can engage with scientific concepts in a relaxed, approachable environment.

## Website Structure

This repository contains the source code for the SCOPE website, built using Hugo with the Lithium theme. The site features:

- Information about our mission and initiatives
- Archive of virtual panel recordings and resources
- Gallery of our Brewing Scientists events
- Resource toolkit for science communication

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from scientists interested in improving science communication and public engagement. Please reach out to us at info@scopecomms.org if you'd like to get involved.

## Website Development

This website is built using:
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - A fast and modern static site generator
- [Hugo Lithium Theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium) - A simple, clean theme
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - For hosting the site
