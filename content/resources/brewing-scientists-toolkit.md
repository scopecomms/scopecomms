# Brewing Scientist: A Toolkit for Communicating Research Through Beer Labels

### A Science For Good Initiative

---
  
## 1. Introduction & Vision
  
  **Brewing Scientists** is a creative science communication initiative that connects research labs with local microbreweries to feature accessible scientific content on beer labels. Launched in North Carolina in collaboration with Steel String Brewery, this initiative aims to scale nationally as a community-driven effort to demystify science, promote public engagement, and celebrate research through an unexpected and beloved medium: beer.

This toolkit will guide you step-by-step—from finding a brewery partner to designing labels, measuring impact, and hosting events—to bring Brewing Scientists to your community.

## 2. Finding & Partnering with Breweries
  
### Identifying Potential Breweries
  
- Search local brewery directories, Yelp, or craft beer associations  
- Look for community-minded or cause-driven businesses  
- Consider university town breweries for greater interest in science  

### Outreach Strategies

**Sample Email Template:**
  
  > Subject: Science + Beer = Community!  
  >  
  > Hi [Brewery Name],  
>  
  > I’m [Your Name], a researcher at [University/Lab], and I’d love to explore a partnership to feature science facts on your beer labels. We’ve successfully done this with Steel String Brewery in NC, and we think your brewery would be a perfect fit. Interested in learning more?  
  >  
  > Cheers,  
> [Your Contact Info]  

**Pitch Points:**
  
  - Promotes local science and education  
- Drives foot traffic and media buzz  
- Co-branded opportunities with institutions and researchers  

### Brewery Collaboration Checklist

- Define label timeline and production volume  
- Clarify responsibilities: design, printing, approvals  
- Sign a simple MOU (provided in Appendix A)

## 3. Selecting and Designing Research Content
  
### What to Share
  
  Each beer label will feature **3–4 concise, engaging research facts**, plus a QR code for deeper learning.

### Content Guidelines

- Accessible language (8th grade reading level)  
- Relatable analogies or metaphors  
- Focused theme per label (e.g., climate, cancer, chemistry)  
- Add a call-to-action: Learn more, support a cause, visit the lab  

### Scientist Submission Template

- Title or catchy phrase  
- 3–4 research facts (1–2 sentences each)  
- Artist credit (if applicable)  
- Optional: Lab logo or headshot (small)  
- QR code link to:  
  - Lab/research abstract (hosted on Science For Good)  
- Educational resource  
- Nonprofit partner

## 4. Label Design & Production
  
### Templates & Tools
  
- Use Steel String Brewery label dimensions (provided in Appendix B)  
- Free design tools: Canva, Adobe Express  
- Access brand guidelines (colors, fonts) if needed  

### Visual Tips

- Prioritize legibility (sans serif fonts, high contrast)  
- Allow white space  
- Highlight 1 fact visually  
- Include:  
  - QR code  
- Artist credit ("Art by [Name]")  
- Science For Good logo (optional)  

### Printing Logistics

- Common label specs: 16 oz can, waterproof vinyl, full-wrap  
- Local or national printers (see Appendix C)  
- Typical cost: $0.20–$0.50 per label

## 5. Funding the Project
  
### Budgeting
  
  - Label printing (based on volume)  
- Design support (optional: pay artists)  
- Marketing or event support  

### Funding Sources

- Lab/department outreach funds  
- NSF Broader Impacts or supplemental grants  
- Institutional partnerships (e.g., SciComm offices)  
- Local sponsors or co-branded partners

## 6. Dissemination & Impact
  
### Ways to Share the Beer
  
  - Taproom launches  
- Community science nights  
- Local science festivals  

### Online Amplification

- Social media graphics (provided in Appendix D)  
- QR code metrics: track scans by location/time  
- Press release template (Appendix E)  

### Measuring Impact

- Survey customers via QR codes ("Did you learn something new?")  
- Collect data on:  
  - Cans distributed  
- QR scans  
- Event attendance  
- Social media engagement  

### Repository

All labels, templates, and extended abstracts will be housed on the **Science For Good website**:
