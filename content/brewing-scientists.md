## Our Approach

Scientists create beer labels with accessible language about their research findings. The public events include scientific presentations geared for the local community, benefiting both scientists and non-scientists.

## Beer Series

We collaborate with Steel String Brewery to create science-themed beverages that communicate complex research in accessible ways.
