We aim to equip scientists from all career stages, backgrounds, and disciplines with tools to build, maintain, and strengthen their communities' trust in science.

## Our Mission

Many societal advancements are rooted in the scientific process; however, the scientific research ecosystem is not optimized to bridge the communication gaps between scientists and their local community members and leaders.

We create a collaborative environment for the next generation of scientists to share innovative approaches and community engagement strategies so scientists across the globe feel empowered to communicate science effectively with communities at large.

## Our Initiatives

* [Virtual Panels](/virtual-panels/) - Online workshops featuring successful science communication projects
* [Brewing Scientists](/brewing-scientists/) - In-person events combining science and craft brewing
